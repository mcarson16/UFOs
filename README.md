# UFOs
## Project Overview
### Purpose: to develop a functional website that displays data pertaining to UFO sightings in the US.
The UFO sighting data has been compiled into a dynamic table that can be filtered based on multiple parameters. This allows for straightforward end-user engagement, encouraging use by amateur and professional analysts alike.

To display the website, open index.html in Visual Studio and right-click to open in Terminal or Live Server.

## Results

The site is set up with all data initially visible in a table. However, the user can filter the table by the following criteria: date, city, state, country, or shape. Multiple filters can be combined for increased specificity.

## Summary
The dynamic table allows an end-user to drill down to specific groupings of data. It's quick, simple, and quite user friendly. Improvements could definitely be made to expand functionality and enhance the appearance. Some of the filter search categories require knowlege of the data to effectively comb through it, e.g. the less intuitive 'Shape' category. To help a user who is less familiar with the data, I would recommend a drop down list of filter categories. Adding a 'Clear Filters' button would enhance the function. Lastly, cleaning the table data to remove typos, sytax oddities, etc. would give an overall sense of polish to the site.

## Recommendations
- Utilize bootstrap to update the filters as drop-down values. 
- Add 'Clear Filters' button.
- Clean source data to improve readability.
