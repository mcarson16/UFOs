# UFOs
## Project Overview
### Purpose: to develop a functional website that displays data pertaining to UFO sightings in the US.
The UFO sighting data has been compiled into a dynamic table that can be filtered based on multiple parameters. This allows for straightforward end-user engagement, encouraging use by amateur and professional analysts alike.

To display the website, open index.html in Visual Studio and right-click to open in Terminal or Live Server.

The site is set up with all data initially visible in a table. However, the user can filter the table by the following criteria: date, city, state, country, or shape.
