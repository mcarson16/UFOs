# UFOs
## Project Overview
### Purpose: to develop a functional website that displays data pertaining to UFO sightings in the US.
The UFO sighting data has been compiled into a dynamic table that can be filtered based on multiple parameters. This allows for straightforward end-user engagement, encouraging use by amateur and professional analysts alike.

To display the website, open index.html in Visual Studio and right-click to open in Terminal or Live Server.

## Results

The site is set up with all data initially visible in a table. However, the user can filter the table by the following criteria: date, city, state, country, or shape.

Multiple filters can be combined for increased specificity.

## Summary
The dynamic table allows an end-user to quickly drill down to specific groupings of data. It's quick, simple, and quite user friendly. That said, the site is very basic in design, and could be improved. Some of the filter search categories require knowlege of the data to effectively comb through it, e.g. the less intuitive 'Shape' category. To help a user who is less familiar with the data, I would recommend a drop down list of filter categories. An archive of the articles that were scraped for data could also be an excellent addition. Lastly, cleaning the table data to remove typos, sytax oddities, etc. would give an overall sense of polish to the site.

## Recommendations
- Utilize bootstrap to update the filters as drop-down values. 
- Broaden site functionality by adding an article database for the documented UFO sightings.
- Clean source data to improve readability.
